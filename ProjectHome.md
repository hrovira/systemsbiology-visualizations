This project will contain Visualizations and Controls developed at the ISB.

Our main goals are to provide rapid development, integration and deployment of rich Visualizations, and to reduce the amount of time and resources required for application development.

Visualization Controls are also included in this project.  These  controls enable users to explore, transform, analyse and export the data.

**ATTENTION**: The visualizations initiative started in this project has migrated to http://visquick.googlecode.com.
